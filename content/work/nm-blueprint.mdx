> *When a core business platform lacks shared understanding, execution isn’t the risk — misalignment is.*



---

## Context

Advisor Desktop sat at the center of the advisor business — the core of the company’s value creation. Yet despite its importance, there was growing ambiguity around:

- What Advisor Desktop actually included (and what it didn’t)
- What legacy systems it replaced — or intentionally wouldn’t
- How it fit alongside adjacent platforms and tools
- Who it was truly for across different advisor and staff segments

Multiple teams were moving forward in parallel, each interpreting the future differently. Without intervention, this ambiguity risked duplicated work, conflicting roadmaps, political friction, and teams losing sight of *why* they were building what they were building.

---

## The leadership problem

Product leadership was relatively new and still building sustained relationships with business stakeholders. There was no durable, shared point of view that leaders could react to, commit to, or explicitly reject.

At the same time:

- The business could not afford slow alignment — the advisor platform was existential.
- Design had only recently been introduced into this business unit.
- Expectations for Design skewed tactical, not strategic.

The real challenge wasn’t UX execution — it was **organizational sense-making**.

---

## The intervention: clarity before correctness

Rather than wait for perfect data or full alignment, I initiated a design-led intervention: the **Field Experience Blueprint**.

The goal was not to ship UI, but to:

- Create an intentional, well-scoped point of view
- Make tradeoffs explicit
- Surface risks early
- Give leaders something concrete to agree on — or disagree with

Even if parts of the vision were never fully realized, clarifying *intent* would enable better decisions than continued ambiguity.

## Constraints by design

To keep the work focused and actionable, I imposed deliberate constraints:

### Time as a forcing function  
Momentum mattered more than perfection.

### “Just-enough” fidelity  
Artifacts were designed to communicate intent and provoke discussion — not invite debate about polish.

### Scoped segments with real stakes  
The blueprint focused on common, high-leverage advisor scenarios:

- Early-career advisors at risk of attrition within their first two years  
- Advisor business owners hiring and managing staff  
- Solo advisors managing their own book of clients  

The same framework later extended to a retiring advisor preparing to sell their book.

These constraints kept the work grounded while still operating at a system level.

## The work

The Field Experience Blueprint articulated:

- Clear **in-scope vs out-of-scope** boundaries for Advisor Desktop  
- A point of view on how it integrated with adjacent platforms  
- Explicit tradeoffs around legacy systems and exclusions  
- Governance, scalability, and measurement risks  
- How different user segments would behave *2–3 years into the future*  
- Where data and workflows were inconsistent across tools  
- What questions future research needed to answer  

Rather than presenting a single “answer,” the blueprint functioned as a **decision framework** — enabling leaders to reason about sequencing, dependencies, and risk holistically.

---

## My role as design leader

I operated as the **direction-setter and connective tissue** across design, product, and the business:

- Set the altitude and intent for the work, framing it as a clarity-driven intervention rather than a traditional UX initiative.
- Secured early buy-in from product leadership, executive leadership, and business stakeholders by positioning the effort as **low-risk, low-cost, high-leverage**.
- Acted as a strategic editor throughout the process — shaping narrative clarity, challenging assumptions, and keeping artifacts focused on decision-making.
- Served as the public face of Product & Design by planning and leading **co-design workshops with influential financial advisors** during quarterly on-site sessions.
- Used live advisor feedback to stress-test understanding, uncover gaps, and inform executive conversations — not just downstream delivery.

---

## Impact

### Organizational clarity and momentum

- Leaders could see the work **holistically**, rather than as disconnected initiatives.
- Dependencies and sequencing became explicit.
- Roadmaps gained confidence and intentionality.
- As leadership changes occurred, teams retained a **north star**, reducing swirl and distraction.

### Foundation for downstream outcomes

The blueprint clarified early-career advisor needs and success criteria in a way that allowed teams to align onboarding, training, and product capabilities around a shared model.

This foundation later supported improvements in under-five-year advisor retention, which increased by more than 20% in 2024.

> *I was no longer at the company when these outcomes were realized, but the clarity established by the Field Experience Blueprint enabled teams to carry the vision forward with confidence.*

---

## What this unlocked

- Design was seen as a **strategic sense-making function**, not just an execution partner.
- Product and business leaders had a shared language for discussing tradeoffs.
- Teams could move faster *because* they were aligned, not despite uncertainty.
- The organization gained a repeatable model for using design to clarify ambiguity at scale.

---

## Why this work matters

The Field Experience Blueprint wasn’t about predicting the future — it was about **making the future discussable**.

By leading with clarity instead of waiting for consensus, Design helped a mission-critical business unit move forward deliberately, even amid change.

## Artifacts & designs (in progress)

> This work included vision artifacts, experience models, and just-enough prototypes used to guide decision-making and surface risk.  
>  
> I’m actively refining how these designs are represented and shared here.
