### Curiosity with Judgment
Ask questions, challenge assumptions, and explore alternatives — but know when to stop exploring and execute.

### Organizations Should Enable Great Work
Great work can happen anywhere, but sustainable impact requires org design that supports clarity, scale, and growth.

### Clarity Is a Leadership Responsibility
Great leaders communicate clearly across channels, document intent, and make decisions easy to find.

### Process Enables Progress
Predictable process creates trust and momentum; bureaucracy is a failure of intent, not a requirement of scale.

### Performance Matters
High standards, clear expectations, and fair accountability are essential to doing meaningful work at scale.

### Invest in Talent — and Be Honest About Gaps
Develop the people you have while recognizing when new skills or perspectives are required.
