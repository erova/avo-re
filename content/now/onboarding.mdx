# Onboarding System (Experiment)

> A lightweight, AI-assisted experiment exploring whether teams really need heavyweight third-party onboarding platforms to deliver value.

---

<OutlineSection title="Why this experiment exists">
This experiment pressure-tests a few assumptions I see repeatedly in enterprise product teams:

- Design leaders should still prototype credible, technically sound solutions  
- Technical rigor isn’t exclusive to engineering leadership  
- Teams may be over-indexing on expensive third-party onboarding tools  

This is **not** an attempt to reinvent onboarding.  
It’s a demonstration of judgment, feasibility, and tradeoffs.

This is **not** an attempt to reinvent onboarding.  
It’s a demonstration of judgment, feasibility, and tradeoffs.

The demo showcases a small set of common onboarding patterns implemented as an owned, code-first system:
- Guided walkthroughs
- Progress checklists
- Contextual help indicators
- Flexible content, including animated gifs to draw attention and illustrate value



<OutlineSection title="What this is (and what it isn’t)">
**This is:**
- A prototype built using AI-assisted “vibe coding”
- A technically deliberate system that separates the onboarding engine from the product UI
- An example of how teams might reclaim ownership over common product patterns

**This is not:**
- A claim that onboarding tours are innovative
- A belief that checklists drive universal adoption
- A production-ready replacement for enterprise tooling
</OutlineSection>

Onboarding guides are often ignored. That reality is acknowledged here.

## Why explore an owned approach

In many enterprise environments, teams default to third-party onboarding platforms that are:
- Expensive
- Heavyweight
- Difficult to customize or evolve
- Tightly coupled to vendor-specific models

This experiment explores what changes when:
- The team owns the implementation
- Patterns are composable and context-aware
- Tradeoffs are explicit rather than hidden behind tooling

The goal is not feature parity — it’s **flexibility, testability, and clarity**.

<OutlineSection title="Core patterns">
- **Guided walkthroughs**  
  Lightweight, dismissible tours tied to real product context

- **Progress tracking**  
  Simple checklists and completion feedback without intrusive UI

- **Ambient help indicators**  
  Subtle visual cues that surface guidance only when relevant
</OutlineSection>

These patterns are intentionally minimal and opinionated.

---

<OutlineSection title="Technical notes">
- The onboarding engine is decoupled from the demo UI  
- Configuration is type-safe and testable  
- The full system is small, fast, and fully owned by the team  

These choices mirror real-world concerns around scale, maintenance, and experimentation — even at prototype stage.

## Comparison to tools like Pendo

This experiment is not positioned as a full replacement for platforms like Pendo.

However, compared to typical third-party onboarding tools, this approach:
- Avoids vendor lock-in
- Is significantly smaller and faster
- Enables deeper product-specific customization
- Treats onboarding as a product concern, not a bolt-on

For some teams, that tradeoff may be worth exploring.

---

## Why this matters

The value of this experiment is not the onboarding UI itself.

It’s a signal that:
- Design leadership can still build and evaluate real solutions
- AI can accelerate credible prototyping without sacrificing technical integrity
- Teams should periodically re-examine the tools they default to — especially for well-understood problems

This artifact exists to spark that conversation.

<OutlineSection title="What I’d explore next">
- Whether onboarding guidance could be progressively revealed based on real usage rather than predefined steps.
- How AI could generate or adapt onboarding flows per role or context  
- Where onboarding stops being helpful and becomes noise for experienced users
- The delta between a solution like this and something that could be production-ready and deployed in an enterprise product

This experiment established (a degree of isoloated) feasibility. The next step is learning the degree of value to expect if we take this further.
