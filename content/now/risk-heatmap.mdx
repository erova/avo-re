title: "Risk Heatmap: Progressive Disclosure Without Breaking Trust"
date: 2025-12-22
summary: "An experiment applying the same scannability, restraint, and progressive disclosure principles used in resume and onboarding flows to a high-density enterprise risk heatmap."

## Why this experiment

In recent experiments (resume presentation and onboarding flows), I focused on a consistent set of principles:

- **Make the primary surface scannable**
- **Reveal detail only when intent is clear**
- **Avoid forcing users into early commitment**
- **Preserve existing mental models**

This risk heatmap experiment applies those same ideas to a very different problem space:  
**high-density, high-stakes enterprise data.**

## Context

Risk heatmaps are one of the most entrenched visual patterns in GRC software.

Users already understand:
- stoplight color systems
- likelihood × impact grids
- clicking a cell to refresh a detailed table below

Because of that familiarity, the goal was *not* to redesign the heatmap — it was to **reduce friction inside a pattern users already trust**.

---

## The Core Problem

Across the existing experience:

- Users frequently click cells just to *peek*
- Clicking immediately replaces context with a dense table
- Users then navigate back to continue scanning

This mirrors the same problem seen in early onboarding flows:
> users are forced to commit before they’re ready.

## Hypothesis

If the heatmap supported **progressive disclosure** — similar to resume sections or onboarding checkpoints — users could:

- understand what’s inside a cell without navigating away
- reserve clicks for intentional deep dives
- scan risk concentration faster and with more confidence

---

## Design Principles (Shared Across Experiments)

This experiment intentionally reuses the same principles introduced elsewhere:

### 1. Scan First, Commit Later
Just as the resume surfaces highlights before details, the heatmap should answer:
> “Is this worth my attention?”

Before asking for a click.

---

### 2. Intentional Interaction
Borrowed from onboarding patterns:
- hover alone is too noisy
- clicks are too final

A **hover-hold** introduces a lightweight signal of intent without adding friction.

---

### 3. No Surprise Navigation
Click behavior remains unchanged.

This mirrors the resume and onboarding approach:
> never punish curiosity with disorientation.

---

## The Experiment

### Hover-Hold Preview (Primary Change)

After a short, intentional pause, a preview panel appears adjacent to the active cell.

- No click required
- No layout shift
- No interruption to scanning

Clicking the cell still applies filters and refreshes the table exactly as before.

---

### Anchored Preview Panel

As with onboarding callouts and resume annotations, the panel is **anchored close to its source**.

This keeps:
- eye movement minimal
- spatial context intact
- cognitive load low

The panel includes only summary-level information:

- Risk count
- Change vs last 30 days
- Workflow status distribution
- Top drivers
- Top owners

It deliberately avoids full tables or scrollable content.

---

### Focus Without Flash

Consistent with other experiments:
- the active element is elevated
- surrounding elements are gently dimmed
- motion is minimal and purposeful

This reinforces focus without visual noise or novelty effects.

---

### Change as a First-Class Signal

Change indicators follow the same principles used in resume metrics and onboarding progress:

- high-contrast pills
- tabular numerals to prevent jitter
- familiar stoplight semantics

Change is visible at a glance, not buried in secondary views.

---

## Two New Elements Being Explored

These extend the same thinking already applied elsewhere.

### Most Common Risk (Single Line)

A single truncated line such as:

> “Most common risk: Third-party access controls”

This mirrors resume summary patterns:
- one strong signal
- no overwhelming detail

---

### Last Updated (Humanized Timestamp)

A lightweight timestamp:

> “Last updated 3 days ago”

This reinforces trust and freshness — the same way onboarding steps signal progress and recency.

---

## What Stayed the Same (Intentionally)

- Stoplight color system
- Grid layout
- Click-to-filter behavior
- Downstream table views

As with onboarding, familiarity was treated as an asset, not a constraint.

---

## Early Observations

- Users can answer “what’s here?” without committing
- Clicks become more intentional
- Scanning across the grid feels faster and calmer
- The heatmap feels more informative without becoming more complex

These are the same outcomes seen in the resume and onboarding experiments — just applied to a denser, more operational surface.

---

## Why This Matters

Across these experiments, a consistent pattern is emerging:

> The biggest UX gains often come from *removing unnecessary commitment*, not adding features.

In enterprise software — especially risk — restraint builds trust faster than novelty.

---

## Next Directions

Potential follow-ups include:

- Measuring preview usage vs click-through
- Comparing stoplight vs modern color modes with identical interactions
- Evaluating keyboard and accessibility parity
- Applying the same preview pattern to other dense dashboards

---

## Closing Thought

This experiment isn’t about making the heatmap “cooler.”

It’s about applying the same discipline used in resumes and onboarding:
- clarity first
- intent-aware disclosure
- and respect for how people already work
