## Why this experiment

Across recent experiments (resume presentation and onboarding), I’ve been exploring the same question:

> How do we help people understand what matters—without forcing early commitment?

Risk heatmaps are familiar and trusted in enterprise GRC. That trust comes from consistency: stoplight colors, likelihood × impact, and a click to drill into a table below. The opportunity here isn’t to reinvent the heatmap—it’s to reduce friction *inside* the pattern.

## The core problem

In the existing experience, users frequently click a cell just to answer “what’s inside?” Clicking immediately refreshes the dense table below, which interrupts scanning and forces context switching.

</figure>

## Design constraints

- Preserve the stoplight mental model and grid layout.
- Keep click behavior unchanged (click still applies the filter and refreshes the table).
- Add only “earned” motion—feedback that clarifies state, not decoration.

## Two high-signal additions

### Most common risk (single line)

In the preview panel, add one line that answers “what is this cluster actually about?” without overwhelming detail.

Example:
<div className="mt-3 rounded-lg border border-neutral-800 bg-neutral-950/40 px-4 py-3 text-sm text-neutral-300">
  <strong className="block text-neutral-100">Example</strong>
  Most common risk: Third-party access controls
</div>

### Last updated (humanized)

Add a lightweight recency indicator to reinforce trust and freshness.

Example:
- “Last updated 3 days ago”

## What stayed the same (intentionally)

- Stoplight semantics
- Likelihood × impact grid
- Click-to-filter behavior and the downstream table view

Familiarity is treated as a trust signal, not a constraint to redesign away.

## Early takeaways

- Users can scan the grid with fewer “peek clicks.”
- Clicks become more intentional (used for commitment, not curiosity).
- The heatmap feels more informative without becoming more complex.

## Next steps

- Validate whether preview reduces click churn and speeds scanning.
- Compare stoplight vs alternate color modes (same interactions).
- Ensure keyboard + accessibility parity for preview behavior.
