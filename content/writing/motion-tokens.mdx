# Motion tokens, not one-off animations

The goal is **consistent feel**, not constant movement.

<MetricTiles
  columns={3}
  items={[
    { label: "Patterns", value: "3", note: "fadeUp, stagger, hoverLift" },
    { label: "Tokens file", value: "1", note: "Single source of truth" },
    { label: "Intent", value: "Calm", note: "Delight, used sparingly" },
  ]}
/>



## Principles
- Use a few patterns everywhere (fadeUp, stagger, hoverLift).
- Keep durations short and easing premium.
- Respect reduced motion.



Later, I’ll publish the exact variants and a few examples of how they show up across navigation, cards, and content.
