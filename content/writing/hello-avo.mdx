title: "Introducing avo.re"
summary: "A pragmatic look at choosing MDX, modern frameworks, and Vercel over traditional CMS platforms."
date: 2026-01-01

## TL;DR


**Platform**  
MDX + modern React framework  
Enables structured storytelling with real components, not screenshots.

**CMS**  
No traditional CMS  
Fewer abstractions, more intent; content is treated as part of the system.

**Hosting**  
Vercel  
Zero-ops deployment, fast iteration, reliable previews.

**WordPress**  
lolnope 
Optimized for different constraints than mine.

**erova.com**  
Evergreen brochure site  
Stable, scannable, changes infrequently.

**avo.re**  
Living system  
Writing, case studies, experiments, and iteration.

## Context

This site wasn’t built to showcase technical prowess for its own sake.  
It was built to support *how I think, write, and work* — and to stay adaptable as those evolve.

I chose to build avo.re using modern tooling (MDX, component-based architecture, server rendering) rather than defaulting to platforms like [WordPress](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1). That decision was intentional, and worth explaining.

---

## Why Not WordPress?

WordPress is powerful, familiar, and battle-tested. It’s also optimized for a very specific set of needs:

- Content managed primarily through a visual editor
- Plugin-driven extensibility
- Long-lived page templates with limited structural variation

None of those were my primary constraints.

What I wanted instead was:
- Full control over layout and information hierarchy
- The ability to mix narrative writing with live components
- A system where structure is explicit, not theme-implied

WordPress *can* be bent to do this — but that bending becomes the work.

---

## Why MDX?

MDX lets me write in Markdown while embedding React components directly in content.

That unlocks a few important things:

- **Narrative + artifacts live together**  
  Case studies can include real components, not screenshots.
- **Structure is intentional**  
  Headings, callouts, metrics, and sections are part of the design system.
- **Content evolves with the system**  
  Writing, layout, and components change together, under version control.

For someone who designs systems for a living, this feels like the right abstraction level.

---

## Architecture (High Level)

At a high level:

- Content lives as `.mdx` files
- Pages are rendered via a modern React framework
- Styling is handled via utility-first CSS
- Hosting and deployment are handled by [Vercel](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=2)

There’s no admin UI. No plugins. No database.

That’s not minimalism for its own sake — it’s fewer moving parts aligned to actual needs.

## avo.re vs erova.com (Two Sites, Two Jobs)

I maintain two sites intentionally:

### **erova.com**
- Evergreen, brochure-style
- Optimized for quick scanning
- Changes infrequently
- Designed to be stable and predictable

It answers:  
**“Who is this person, at a glance?”**

### **avo.re**
- Living system
- Writing, case studies, experiments
- Actively evolving
- Structure adapts as my work and thinking evolve

It answers:  
**“How does this person think, work, and make decisions?”**

Trying to make one site do both jobs well usually means neither does.

---

## Hosting on Vercel

Vercel made sense because:

- Deployments are automatic and atomic
- Preview URLs make iteration easy
- Performance and caching are handled by default

More importantly, it removes *operational distraction*.  
I don’t want to maintain servers — I want to write, design, and iterate.

---

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Speed of iteration**  
  Structural changes are straightforward.
- **Expressiveness**  
  Content isn’t constrained by a CMS schema.
- **Clear signal**  
  This site reflects curiosity, judgment, and comfort working adjacent to engineering.

---

## Tradeoffs (Real Ones)

This approach isn’t free:

- There’s no visual editor
- Writing assumes some technical comfort
- Simple changes sometimes require touching code

For me, those are acceptable tradeoffs.  
For many teams or use cases, they wouldn’t be.

Architecture should match intent.

---

## Why This Matters Professionally

I’m not trying to be a developer.  
I *am* trying to be a design leader who understands systems, constraints, and modern production realities.

Choosing MDX over WordPress isn’t about novelty — it’s about staying fluent in the tools and patterns shaping how products are built today.

That fluency informs better decisions everywhere else.

---

## Closing Thought

Good platforms remove friction.  
Great ones align with how you think.

This site is an experiment in the latter.
