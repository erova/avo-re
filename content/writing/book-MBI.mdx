## Book Review: *Mastering Behavioral Interviews*

*Mastering Behavioral Interviews* stands out in a crowded field of LinkedIn advice, YouTube videos, and other books by treating interviewing not as a memorization exercise, but as a discipline of intentional communication. Rather than coaching readers to “game” behavioral questions, the book focuses on helping candidates clearly articulate how they think, act, learn, and create impact—exactly what interviewers are actually trying to assess. Let me also get this out of the way quickly: Austen was a Senior Engineering Manager at Meta for almost 10 years; we partnered together when I was managing designers supporting his teams’ work and he provided a copy of his book in advance to review. 

While written for an engineering audience, it’s not a stretch to abstract his clear, practical point of view from engineering and apply it to those in product design, product management, or even other adjacent product development roles (such as data scientists, product marketing managers, ux researchers, content strategists) who may struggle with accurately and effectively capturing the nuances of their work. The lessons in communicating impact, scope, complexity and ambiguity, and navigating conflict and success span far beyond simple job titles or reporting lines. In fact, McDonald’s book would help any organization or functional leader reflect on how they are leveling their teams, reviewing performance, and hiring & promoting people as they read the sample scenarios, prompts, and responses. 

One of the book’s strongest contributions is its clear preference for the **CARL framework (Context, Actions, Results, Learnings)** over the more commonly cited (and Amazon’s preferred) STAR  method. While Situation, Task, Action, Result is familiar, the book makes a compelling case that it often falls short—especially for more senior candidates—because it omits reflection. CARL’s explicit inclusion of *Learnings* gives interviewers signal on judgment, growth, and scope, not just execution. McDonald also cites that less experienced interviewees frequently risk commingling tasks and actions when relying on the STAR framework, muddling the interview. By focusing on CARL instead, the result is storytelling that feels more mature, intentional, and aligned with how experienced interviewers evaluate candidates.

More broadly, the book reinforces the idea that **communicating through frameworks signals intentionality**. Responses structured around CARL aren’t just easier to follow—they demonstrate how a candidate organizes complexity, prioritizes information, and reflects on outcomes. That meta-signal alone is incredibly valuable, especially in senior or leadership interviews where clarity of thinking matters as much as the story itself. Both people who are actively interviewing for a new role and those who are content in their current positions will benefit from McDonald’s advice reflecting on how they can use frameworks to consistently break down a problem at several altitudes and points of view, whether they’re in an interview or leading a kickoff meeting. 

The guidance on **what interviewers are actually assessing** is refreshingly explicit. The sections on the “Big Three” questions—particularly *Tell Me About Yourself*—are some of the clearest and most practical I’ve seen. Instead of vague advice, the book breaks down what a strong answer must accomplish, how much detail is appropriate, and how to leave space for follow-up. This alone makes the book useful even for candidates who feel “interviewed out” but want to sharpen their signal.

A standout concept is the **Story Catalog**. While framed as interview prep, it’s arguably one of the book’s most broadly useful ideas. Building a structured catalog of career stories—complete with context, actions, outcomes, and learnings—is valuable not just for interviews, but for performance reviews, promotion packets, and self-reflection. Even for those not actively job hunting, the process helps build self-awareness and narrative fluency around one’s own impact.

The **Pitfalls** section is another highlight. Organized by signal area, it functions as a practical checklist for self-editing stories: what you’re over-emphasizing, what you might be under-selling, and where ambiguity or lack of ownership could raise red flags. It’s especially helpful for experienced candidates who assume their stories “speak for themselves” but may be missing key evaluative signals.

Finally, the chapter on **adapting responses for Big Tech** (notably around page 224) is both concrete and nuanced. Rather than encouraging candidates to cosplay scale they haven’t experienced, it focuses on reframing language, impact, and decision-making in ways that align with Big Tech expectations—systems thinking, data-driven framing, ownership, and cross-functional influence. This advice alone makes me almost want to re-interview as I had little clue what I was doing in the interview process and just answered the interviewer panel’s questions with little intentionality (even though I was still effective enough, obviously). If I only knew then what I know now, as the swan song goes. 

The **appendix** deserves special mention. Packed with prompts and questions, it provides a practical toolkit for building a story catalog and pressure-testing responses against likely interview themes. It’s the kind of resource readers will return to repeatedly.

Overall, *Mastering Behavioral Interviews* succeeds because it treats interviews as a communication craft, not a performance trick. It’s useful for early-career candidates, invaluable for senior leaders, and surprisingly effective as a tool for reflection even outside the job search.
